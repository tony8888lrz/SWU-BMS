## Introduction
This Python-based university library management system integrates a SQLite database (back-end) with a LayUI web interface (front-end). The database design strictly follows third normal form (3NF) principles to ensure data normalization and minimize redundancy (refer to data.sqlite for the schema).
## Prerequisites
Before running, please ensure the following requirements are met:
- Conda (Python 3.9)
- Other packages are listed in requirements.txt.
### Intro
It is a university library management system developed with python. It combines a back-end database（Python with Sqlite) and a front-end web interface(LayUI).
I literally define the database(in 3rd normal form) for the entire management system(Seeing the file data.sqlite）
## Test
You can work with the test, which will help you run smoothly with this software.
